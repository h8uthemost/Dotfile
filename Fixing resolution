This is how to fix the resolution size in say, i3wm. 

First create a .Xresources file in your home directory. Then put this in the file:

*dpi: 150
Xft.dpi: 150

You can change that value to 125 or whatever you like. After creating and inputting the above into the .Xresources file run this command in terminal:

xrdb ~/.Xresources (actually put that in .bashrc)

And that's it! You should now have a larger resolution. Log in and out of your wm so it takes effect in the bar.
